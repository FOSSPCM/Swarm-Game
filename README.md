# Swarm Game

**Swarm Game** is a simple game made with the Python Arcade engine.
The object of the game is to pick up all of the jewels that appear on screen, while avoiding all the poison bubbles.
You control your character using the mouse (or trackpad, or whatever you use to move the mouse cursor on your computer), and you pick up the jewels by touching them. You "die" if you touch the poison.
Press "Q" to quit at any time, and press "P" to pause the game.

The game's name, which isn't very unique, I know; comes from the fact that everything that appears on screen is coming at you from the left, right, top, and bottom; and there is a lot of it "swarming" the player. I believe this game is called a "Bullet Hell."

The purpose for writing this game was for me to learn how a game engine worked. I was also itching to pick up Python again, having been using other languages for quite some time now. It was pretty neat.

## "build" Instructions

To build this game from source, you need Python 3. I used 3.10.5, but I'm sure newer versions of Python 3 will work just fine.
You will also need Python Arcade. Just run `pip install arcade` if you don't have it.
There is only one Python file, but there are a few PNG and WAV files that are needed. Make sure the "images" and "sfx" directories are right next to "swarmgame.py."
Run the swarmgame.py, and you should be good to go!

No executable binary is made, so you aren't really "bulding" anything, but whatever. It works and that's what matters.

## Tools used

Notepad++. I normally use Vim, but this was the editor I picked this time around.
I used Python 3 with the Python Arcade and Random libraries. 
Also used GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, for editing some of the sprites.

## Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* The code quality could use some TLC, and it also needs some performance tweeks.
* The algorithms for how the sprites are being spawned needs work.
* Adding a start screen would be nice.
* Adding a reset key would also be nice.
* At some point, I would like to use my own assets instead of borrowing others' work.
